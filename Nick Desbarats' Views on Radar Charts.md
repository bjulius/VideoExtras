## Executive Summary

Nick Desbarats, a data visualization expert and instructor, maintains a nuanced position on radar/spiderweb charts: **he avoids them not because they're inherently bad, but because better alternatives always exist for the same insights.** His primary argument is that heatmaps and overlapping cycle charts consistently communicate the same information more clearly and to audiences who are already familiar with these chart types.

---

## Detailed Summary of His Views

### Core Position

- **He avoids using radar graphs** in everyday business reports and presentations, but emphasizes they're not inherently "bad" or "useless"
- **His main argument:** Any insight visible in a radar graph is **at least as clear (or clearer)** in more informative and familiar chart types, so there's no situation where radar graphs are the best choice (with one rare exception)

### Why He Avoids Them

**Better alternatives always exist** for the two common uses of radar charts:

1. **For comparing items by attributes** → Use **heatmaps** instead
   - Heatmaps make insights "considerably clearer"
   - They remain intelligible even with many items (whereas radar charts become a mess)
   - Multivariate profile comparison is at least as easy in heatmaps
   - Most audiences already know how to read heatmaps

2. **For cyclical time series data** → Use **"overlapping cycles" charts** (line charts) instead
   - Standard line charts are considerably more familiar
   - They actually reveal more insights than radar graphs
   - Example: He noticed a "Wednesday dip" pattern in a line chart that wasn't as obvious in the radar version

**Perceptual and usability issues:**

- Become essentially **unintelligible with more than 4-5 overlapping items**
- **Category order matters dramatically:** The same item with identical values can look completely different just by reordering the spokes/categories
- Even when split into "small multiples" to reduce clutter, comparing items becomes considerably more difficult
- Multivariate profile comparison (a claimed advantage) is actually **easier in heatmaps**

**Human impact - the most important reason:**

- He's witnessed people **"feel stupid"** because they struggled to read or understand radar graphs
- His best reason to avoid them: **"to avoid making people feel dumb for no reason"**
- He emphasizes the emotional and cognitive burden radar charts place on audiences

### The ONE Exception

**When values are associated with points on a circle:**
- Example: Wind direction in "wind rose" charts used in maritime navigation and aviation
- This is **rare in practice** for most business applications
- The circular arrangement makes sense because the data itself is circular/directional
- Car features, days of the week, etc. are NOT naturally circular, so showing them in a circle is "perceptually dicey"

### Important Clarifications

**He's not against unfamiliar chart types in general:**
- He recommends other unfamiliar types (scatter plots, histograms, step charts) when they're genuinely the best choice
- The difference: those chart types have situations where more familiar options can't communicate the same insights

**He's not opposed to audience education:**
- He encourages asking audiences to learn new chart types
- BUT only when those types offer unique value that justifies the learning investment
- Radar graphs don't meet this threshold because alternatives are both clearer AND more familiar

**The alternatives reveal MORE, not less:**
- In his examples, he noticed insights in heatmaps and line charts that weren't as obvious in radar graphs
- This contradicts the common assumption that specialized charts offer more information

### Related Philosophy

From his article "Are there 'bad' chart types?":
- He rejects the notion that every chart type must have situations where it's the best choice
- Just because a chart type exists doesn't mean it has optimal use cases
- The burden of proof is on demonstrating unique value, not on avoiding all chart types

**Key quotes from the article:**

> "I don't think radar graphs are 'bad' or 'useless.' You can get useful insights from radar graphs. What I am suggesting is that any insight that can be spotted in a radar graph is at least as clear in more informative and familiar chart types, so there are no situations in which radar graphs are the best choice."

> "I avoid radar graphs because more informative and familiar chart types like heatmaps and overlapping cycle charts can always communicate the same insights as a radar graph, AFAIK."

> "Possibly the best reason to avoid radar graphs (or any needlessly complicated chart type), then, is to avoid making people feel dumb for no reason."

## Key Takeaways for Data Visualization Practitioners

1. **Consider audience cognitive load:** Even if you understand a chart type, your audience may struggle unnecessarily

2. **Familiarity has value:** When two chart types show the same insight equally well, choose the more familiar one

3. **Question assumptions:** Just because a chart type exists and is popular doesn't mean it's optimal

4. **Emotional impact matters:** Making stakeholders feel confused or inadequate damages the communication goal

5. **The exception proves the rule:** Wind rose charts work because the data is genuinely circular—apply this test to your own data

6. **Visual "coolness" isn't a criterion:** Radar charts may look impressive, but impressive ≠ effective
