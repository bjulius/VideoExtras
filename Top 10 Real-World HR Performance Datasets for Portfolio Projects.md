- Time series analysis possible with annual updates
- Geographic and demographic segmentation capabilities

### Practical Application

- **FedScope** lets you build custom queries - perfect for tailored analysis

- **NHS and Australian** data includes validated absence/performance correlations
- Mix public and survey data for comprehensive insights

## Recommended Approach

Here's how I'd tackle this for maximum portfolio impact:

1. **Select 2-3 complementary datasets** (e.g., one US city + FedScope + international)
2. **Focus on a specific HR challenge** (retention, performance management, compensation equity)
3. **Build a narrative around real organizational problems** these datasets reveal
4. **Demonstrate actionable insights** that could inform actual HR decisions
5. **Include data quality assessment** as part of your analysis

Remember - these datasets represent real people's careers and livelihoods. That authenticity will make your portfolio stand out from projects using synthetic data. Plus, being able to say "I analyzed actual government employee performance data affecting 40,000+ workers" carries way more weight than "I used a simulated HR dataset."

The data cleaning challenges you'll encounter are also portfolio gold - showing how you handle missing values, inconsistent formats, and real-world data issues is exactly what employers want to see.
